# Heart-Rate-Calculation
Python code that calculates heart rate and provides an output based on the user's condition
Here's how you can use the code:

1. The code prompts the user to enter their age.
2. It calculates the target heart rate range based on the age entered.
3. Then, it asks the user to enter their current heart rate.
4. The code determines the user's condition based on the entered heart rate and the calculated target range.
5. Finally, it prints the target heart rate range, the user's heart rate, and their condition.

Please note that this code assumes the user enters valid integer values for age and heart rate. Make sure to handle any potential exceptions or input validation as per your requirements.
